## Technical Background
Most of my experience is Tech is physically writing code. I have an Associates from Kellogg Community College in Computer Programming. I took 2 years of C++ which is/was my main language, but It has since swapped to python after transferring. I also had a few classes in App development, Visual Studio, and a bit of work with security and IP's, however none of those clicked with me as coding did.
